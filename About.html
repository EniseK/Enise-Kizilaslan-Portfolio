			<h1>About me</h1>
			<h3>Coding student from Hannover, Germany</h3>
			<div class="me-paragraphs">
				<p class="text-justify about paragraph">
					I am a 38 year-old educator and mathematician who decided to make a
					career change. Since I have always been curious about coding, I
					thought, it was now time to pursue this area. I am married and have
					two daughters, aged five and ten. My family and I temporarily live in
					Hannover, Germany as expats. We are planning to retun to Michigan, USA
					in a few years. Even though my children were born in Michigan and we
					lived there for about 15 years, my husband and I are originally from
					Turkey and spent our childhood in a sothern city, called Gaziantep. We
					enjoy traveling as a family, learn new languages and meet different
					cultures.
